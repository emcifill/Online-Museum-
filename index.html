               History is the systematic study of the past, focusing primarily on the human past. As an academic discipline, it analyses and interprets evidence to construct narratives about what happened and explain why it happened. Some theorists categorize history as a social science, while others see it as part of the humanities or consider it a hybrid discipline. Similar debates surround the purpose of history—for example, whether its main aim is theoretical, to uncover the truth, or practical, to learn lessons from the past. In a more general sense, the term history refers not to an academic field but to the past itself, times in the past, or to individual texts about the past.

               <h2>Prehistoric Era</h2>
               <p>The Prehistoric Age refers to the vast period of human history before the invention of writing systems, meaning no written records exist from this time. It spans from the emergence of the first human ancestors millions of years ago up until about 5,000 years ago, when writing began in ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia and Egypt.</p>

               <h2>Classical Era</h2>
               <p>Classical antiquity, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, is the period of cultural European history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD. It comprises the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, known together as the Greco-Roman world, which played a major role in shaping the culture of the Mediterranean Basin. It is the period during which ancient Greece and Rome flourished and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Classical antiquity was succeeded by the period now known as late antiquity.</p>

               <p>The Early Modern Era is the period in history that bridges the Middle Ages and the modern world, roughly spanning from the late 15th century to the late 18th century (about 1500–1800). It was a time of great change and innovation that shaped the foundations of today’s societies.</p>

               <h2>Modern</h2>
               <p>The modern era or the modern period is considered the current historical period of human history. It was originally applied to the history of Europe and Western history for events that came after the Middle Ages, often from around the year 1500, like the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism. Since the 1990s, it has been more common among historians to refer to the period after the Middle Ages and up to the 19th century as the early modern period. The modern period is today more often used for events from the 19th century until today. The time from the end of World War II (1945) can also be described as being part of contemporary history. The common definition of the modern period today is often associated with events like the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the transition from nationalism toward the liberal international order.</p>
