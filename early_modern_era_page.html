	Early modern kings, roughly from 1500 to 1800, transitioned from the often limited power of medieval rulers to more centralized 
	monarchies, adopting the images of a "father" who
	provided for the realm and a "warrior" who protected it. They ruled through increasingly formal courts, used propaganda and religious justification (like the divine right of kings), 
	and shifted their focus from domestic power struggles to forming diplomatic alliances with other monarchies. However, their authority was still challenged by ideas of individual rights and national sovereignty.

	<blockquote class="blockquote" cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Europe/The-peasantry"> 
	In 1700 only 15 percent of Europe’s population lived in towns, but that figure concealed wide variations: at the two extremes by 1800 were Britain with 40 percent and Russia with 4 percent.
	Most Europeans were peasants, dependent on agriculture. The majority of them lived in nucleated settlements and within recognized boundaries, those of parish or manor, but some, in the way characteristic of the hill farmer,
	lived in single farms or hamlets. The type of settlement reflected its origins: pioneers who had cleared forests or drained swamps, Germans who had pressed eastward into Slav lands, Russians who had replaced conquered Mongols,
	Spaniards who had expelled the Moors. Each brought distinctive characteristics. Discounting the nomad fringe, there remains a fundamental difference between serfs and those who had more freedom,
	whether as owners or tenants paying some form of rent but both liable to seigneurial dues. There were about one million serfs in eastern France and some free peasants in Russia, so the pattern is untidy;
	but broadly it represents the difference between eastern and western Europe. </blockquote>
